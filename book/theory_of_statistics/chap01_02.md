## 1.2 Exchangeability

### 1.2.1 Distributional Symmetry

### Definition 1.11 Exchangeable
* $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$,
    * random quantities

$X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$ is said to be exchangeable if 

$$
  \sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_{n},
  \
  (X_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, X_{\sigma(n)})
  \sim
  (X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n})
  .
$$

* $(X_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$,
    * random quantities

$(X_{i})$ is said to be exchangeable if for every finite sequence are exchangeable.
