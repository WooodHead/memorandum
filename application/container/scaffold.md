## Scaffold
Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications.

* No server-side component. No overhead to your cluster.
* Detect changes in your source code and automatically build/push/deploy.
* Image tag management. Stop worrying about updating the image tags in Kubernetes manifests to push out changes during development.
* Supports existing tooling and workflows. Build and deploy APIs make each implementation composable to support many different workflows.
* Support for multiple application components. Build and deploy only the pieces of your stack that have changed.
* Deploy regularly when saving files or run one off deployments using the same configuration.
