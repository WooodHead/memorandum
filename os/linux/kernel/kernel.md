* RawDisk
    * [Raw disk definition by The Linux Information Project](http://www.linfo.org/raw_disk.html)
    * The term raw disk refers to the **accessing of the data on a hard disk drive (HDD) or other disk storage device** or media directly at the individual byte level instead of through its filesystem as is usually done.
