# Latex Style Guideline

* Although you need to define all symbols in your documents, the guideline do not force to use specific symbols.
* This guideline only considers math formula in `equation` and `eqnarray` envrioment.

## equation environment

## eqnarray environment

```latex
\begin{eqnarray}
    
\end{eqnarray}
```

## Partial Derivative

```latex
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} 
f(\theta)
```

```latex
\left.
    \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^{\prime}} 
    f(\theta)
\right|_{\theta^{\prime}
```

## Brackets


```latex
\left(
    a + by
\right)
```
